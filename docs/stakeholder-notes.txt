Notes on the organisation of the festival/party:

1. Festival
- The festival is a recurring event
- Every festival is defined by a start and an end date and a name
e.g. "Wild Carrot 2021" - 2021-07-01 to 2021-07-04

2. Ticket
- Every person attending must have a ticket for a festival
- A ticket is valid only for the time of the festival
- A ticket must have a unique id
- There are 3 types of tickets - early bird (reduced price) - normal - staff (free)
- The type of the ticket should be changeable (e.g. a person has purchased a normal ticket and becomes staff)
- A ticket must be personalized. There cannot be a ticket without a person assigned to it.
- A ticket must have a price, issue datetime and an indication whether it has already been registered (at the festival site) or not.
